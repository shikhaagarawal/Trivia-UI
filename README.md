## Business Requirements
- The application should run in completely automatic mode - i.e no admin intervention should be required to start the game (once a
minimum number of players have joined) or advance the game to the next round.
- The application should allow running multiple games simultaneously.
- The application should allow a reasonably large number of players to participate in each game (think hundreds).
- The application should display statistics about player choices at the end of each round (how many players have chosen each answer).

## Game Flow

- Question will appear on screen. Once answer is selected, all other options gets disabled.
- 15 seconds will be given to choose a answer.

- On stats screen, wait for 10 seconds before 
    - Next question appear on screen, Or
    - Show winner page, Or
    - Show thank you page.

#### Multiple Games flow
- Once minimum players(say P1 & P2) join the game(say GAME_1), game countdown(10s) will start.
- All others players(say P3 & P4) joining within running 10s countdown will join GAME_1.
- GAME_1 will start quiz, say level1.
- Other player(say P5) wants to play the game then he will be added in new game(say GAME_2) and wait for other players to join.
- Other player(say P6) start the game, he will be added in GAME_2 and game countdown(10s) will start.
- GAME_1 and GAME_2 will have their own players,questions and winners.

#### Finding winner
