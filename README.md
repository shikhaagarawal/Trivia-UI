# Trivia

It is a multiplayer online game in which players have to quickly answer random problems.
The game consist of multiple levels and as the player make right choice to the question, they advance to the next level.

## How to play
- Navigate to the Home Page via https://trivia-sa.herokuapp.com
- Click on a link on the page that will redirect to https://trivia-game-sa.herokuapp.com
- Enter your name and click start game. "Waiting for other players..." msg will be shown.
- Ask a friend or on a different window, perform the above steps.
- Once minimum players join the game, a 10 second countdown will start.
- Quickly answer random math addition questions in order to win the game.

## Requirements
- The application should run in completely automatic mode - i.e no admin intervention should be required to start the game (once a
minimum number of players have joined) or advance the game to the next round.
- The application should allow running multiple games simultaneously.
- The application should allow a reasonably large number of players to participate in each game (think hundreds).
- The application should display statistics about player choices at the end of each round (how many players have chosen each answer).

## Game Flow
- Game starts, once a minimum number of players have joined a game session. For demo purposes, the minimum number of players is configured to 2.
- Any new player, who joins in the waiting time before the 1st question is displayed, also gets to play in the same game session.
- Any player who joins after an existing game has started, will have to wait for the next game to begin.
- Questions will appear on the player's screen. Once an answer is chosen, all other choices get disabled.
- 15 seconds will be given to make a choice of the right answer. If a player makes no choice within 15 sec, they get disqualified.
- Stats are displayed for 10 seconds at the end of each question.

### Finding winner
- A game session can go upto N levels. For demo purposes, the number of levels is set to 5.
- In case no player makes it to the final level, then the game declares the last standing player, with a correct answer, as the winner.
- In case multiple players submit the correct answer in the last round, then the player answering the question in the minimum amount of time is declared as the winner. 
- In case none of the players submits a correct answer at any given level then no winner is found, and the game session will end.
